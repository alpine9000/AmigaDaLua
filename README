This is AmigaDaLua based on Lua 5.4.8.

This fork has (some) Amiga NDK bindings such that
you can write Amiga programs in Lua.

NOTE: This is incomplete and not really usable for
anything for the time being.

For installation instructions, license details, and
further information about Lua, see doc/readme.html.
